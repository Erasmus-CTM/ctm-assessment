You are taking over the CTM Assessment consolidation, a set of Quarto extensions for interactive maths and Python course pages. The owner is Andrey Chesnokov (AC). You work across these GitHub repositories:

- Erasmus-CTM: ctm-assessment (the umbrella package), ctm-libs (shared library), ctm-checkers (all checker Python, including the STACK engine), math-exercise, py-exercise, pyodide-interaktiv (working branch `feature/shared-feedback-integration`) and stack-sympy.
- aacchhee: ctm-demo (test course), ingmat3a_ntnu (real course) and the fork aacchhee/jsxgraph-quarto (PR #2 to upstream jsxgraph/jsxgraph-quarto).

AGENTS AND MODELS (AC's instruction)
- For software development (engineering subagents), use model 6.1 Sol at medium reasoning. Raise it, up to xhigh, for difficult cases: concurrency and runtime races, browser timing bugs, golden-table or grading changes, and cross-repo set mechanics.
- For every independent review, use Astra at xhigh. A reviewer never reviews its own code.

START HERE
1. In every repo, read `HANDOFF-2026-10.md` on the branch `handoff/2026-10`. Each file holds that repo's state, its open PRs, the next work in order and its known follow-ups. Each ends with the same "Common context", and those rules are binding.
2. Designs: Erasmus-CTM/ctm-assessment `docs/consolidation/`. The step-2, step-3 and step-4 designs are on main. The step-5 offline/exam design and the variants design (with its review) are on the `handoff/2026-10` branch. "AC's decisions" and "Revision after review" sections override the rest of a design.

BINDING RULES (summary; the handoff files have the details)
- AC merges everything. You never merge, never force-push a published branch and never create tags. Merges are merge commits only.
- Merge protocol for sets of cross-repo PRs (ctm-assessment docs, step-1 §12.1):
  - Pin dependencies at the reviewed PR head commits, never at merge commits, and add no review-ref trailers.
  - Every branch must be up to date with its base.
  - One combined CI run must test the whole set.
  - AC merges the set in one sitting, in the order you state.
  - Check before sending: head SHAs unchanged and not behind. Check after AC merges: each merge tree equals its head tree.
- Commits are authored AND committed as `Andrey Chesnokov <aacchhee@gmail.com>`, with a trailer naming you as co-author.
- Every PR gets an independent review: a reviewer that did not write the code, at maximum effort. Repeat it until nothing substantive remains, and watch CI until it is green. Only then send the PR to AC.
- No code duplication across repos: one home per piece of code. Generated copies are made and CI-checked by script.
- No backwards-compatibility break without AC's approval.
- Licences: code is AGPL-3.0-or-later. CTM question XML is CC BY-SA 4.0. STACK fixtures are GPL-3.0, with a notice. HELM rows are CC BY-NC (test data only).
- No HTML in Markdown authoring. ingmat3a must build green and clean.
- Wording rule (STACK): two upstream STACK security issues were reported privately. In anything public (code, docs, CHANGELOG, PR bodies, commit messages), describe only what OUR engine does. Never describe how STACK handles feedback-variable names or which question-variable names it lets students type.
- Courses: ingmat3a stays pinned to ctm-assessment 9ed46a4 until its migration PR. ingmat3a's `linalg-branch` is merged into main; other people may still work on ingmat3a, so touch only your migration branch. ctm-demo follows `ref: main`.

IMMEDIATE TASKS, in order

A. Review the two finished but unreviewed sets. Report each to AC with a verdict, a merge order and the links.
   1. Step-4 final set: ctm-libs #30 (head a3df529), then ctm-assessment #24 (head f215775, 0.12.0). It covers:
      - links into collapsed callouts;
      - flagging a dropped construct in migrations;
      - a Myers diff fallback for long pages;
      - re-pinning ctm-checkers 0.2.0 → 0.6.0 (parity showed 0 differences over 10,541 responses).
      Check carefully that the diff fallback and the new expectation rules cannot hide real differences: mutate them. A WebKit ResizeObserver console error on ingmat3a/linalg pages also occurs on main, and is likely JSXGraph's; confirm.
   2. STACK set: ctm-checkers #10 (S-07, 0.7.0), #11 (S-05, 0.8.0), #12 (S-10, 0.9.0), #13 (S-11, 0.10.0), then stack-sympy #28 (pins #13's head). All target main. Check:
      - every golden-row change, against the native STACK oracle (PHP + Maxima 5.46 at STACK 4.13.1 10d3233 and 4.14.0 3338304);
      - the mutation coverage;
      - the wording rule.
      AC has already decided the open points recorded in the PR bodies:
      - S-07 accepts multiplicationsign none and matrixparens "(";
      - S-05's 4 rows becoming 0.7 is fine;
      - S-10's nested-list message is fine;
      - S-11's hyperbolic case is fixed later, with S-12;
      - S-11's LowestTerms case is to be discussed with AC before any change.
B. jsxgraph-quarto PR #2 is NOT yours: AC and Claude handle its review and the contact with the maintainer. It now requires JSXGraph >= 1.14.1 (head 21c5f9c). Your only JSXGraph task is in D: re-pin the courses from the fork to upstream after AC tells you PR #2 is merged.
C. The ingmat3a migration set. ingmat3a is STAGED for migration (21 Oct, 19:50): AC merged `linalg-branch` into ingmat3a main (a0a34ee, PR #15); main builds green on the old pin 9ed46a4. Branch `consolidation/2026-10-step4-migration` (commit 5ad31ab) holds the first commit: `ref: main` in quarto-extensions.yml and `/_extensions/ctm-checkers/` in .gitignore (G1). No PR yet. Do the migration on that branch AFTER AC has merged the step-4 final set (ctm-libs #30, then ctm-assessment #24), which adds the callout fix and the dropped-construct check the migration relies on. Then, the same method as ctm-demo:
   - first commit `ref: main`;
   - run the converter (ctm-assessment `build-course.py --convert`) and review every construct by hand;
   - add `.gitignore` `/_extensions/ctm-checkers/`;
   - get 0 warnings;
   - compare old and new, rendered and in the browser (3 engines, `--shard`);
   - AC's acceptance: screenshots at desktop and 390 px showing that the "Gå i dybden" blocks look good and the lecture/learning buttons work.
D. Small sets:
   - L3x + U3c: remove the ai-feedback alias (step-3 design §10 / §18.6).
   - Re-pin courses from the JSXGraph fork to upstream, once PR #2 is merged.
   - The remaining STACK chain: S-12, S-04, S-08, S-09, S-06, then S-14 in stack-sympy.
E. Larger work, in this order unless AC says otherwise:
   - step-4 phase B: the store, autosave, progress, quizzes, and B7 export ("Eksporter svarene mine": in-page text with "Kopier alt" first);
   - step 5: the offline/exam build. The December exam is a target, not a constraint. AC is clarifying the exam-server questions with NTNU's exam IT;
   - question tests shared with STACK;
   - variants;
   - H1;
   - step-4 phase C (languages);
   - steps 6–8.

ENVIRONMENT HINTS from the previous session (they may not apply to you):
- GitHub GraphQL, codeload.github.com and jsDelivr were blocked. Actions logs could not be downloaded, so read the check-run annotations instead. Browser tests route CDN requests to local files.
- Only Chromium ran locally; Firefox and WebKit run in CI.
- Quarto is 1.8.27 and Pyodide 0.28.3; 0.27.2 is also tested.

HOW TO REPORT TO AC
- Report only what he needs: the PR links, the merge order, and his decisions with a recommendation for each. Keep it short and plain.
- Ask before anything irreversible, anything that touches a course's main branch, and any choice the designs don't cover.
- Before making changes, read the prior work: the handoff files, the designs, the PR bodies and the earlier reviews. Don't start from scratch.
